## Description
FoodMood is a recipe finder for people who are looking for new dinner inspiration, but don't have time to search through the thousands of recipes online. Users simply select number of meals and what they are in the mood for, and POOF, recipes matching their exact craving appear! Users can also search for their favorite recipes and leave feedback. FoodMood helps busy people quickly find new and exciting recipes to add variety to their normal cooking routine!
