# FoodMood

## Description
FoodMood is a recipe finder for people who are looking for new dinner inspiration, but don't have time to search through the thousands of recipes online. Users simply select number of meals and what they are in the mood for, and POOF, recipes matching their exact craving appear! Users can also search for their favorite recipes and leave feedback. FoodMood helps busy people quickly find new and exciting recipes to add variety to their weekly meals!

## Installation
Fork and clone this repository as well as the [Rails API Backend](https://github.com/pete3249/js-rails-foodmood-backend). 

Install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/) and run `rails db:create` in the API to create a database for your application. Then, run `rails db:migrate` and `rails db:seed` to add recipes to the database. Finally, run `rails s` to start the Rails server and navigate to the homepage [localhost:3000](localhost:3000/) to confirm it is working correctly (you should see the 'Yay! You're on Rails!' screen).

Next, open the index.html file with the default browser, by typing `open index.html` from the frontend directory. There, you can begin to browse and search recipes!
